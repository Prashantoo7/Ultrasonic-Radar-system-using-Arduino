Trying to do demonstration of RADAR system using Arduino IDE and processing softwares:

Simulation detects and locate the object.

IDE code includes interfacing of servo motor and ultrasonic sensor- HCSR04

Guidlines to use:
* first run the IDE code (i.e Radar.ino) and then run arduino processing code.
* It detects the object between 0-40cm and led blinks when object is detected.
